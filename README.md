# Excel.Net
Import/Export Excel Xslx files for .NET plattform (C#)

## Description

This is a library for reading Excel (xlst) content files. The code is based on the integrated ZIP-library in .net 4.5 and the standard XML-serializer of .net.

## Credits

This work is based on Dietmar Paul Schoder article and I only added a small functionality to read Defined Names (used commonly in formulas) and fix some little errors I found on the way.
